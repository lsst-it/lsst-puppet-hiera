# resolv.conf only allows for 6 search domains, and Kubernetes uses 3 for
# service discovery. Additional search domains are ignored. To ensure
# reasonable behavior we remove all domains that will not be readily used
# within Kubernetes - if other domains are needed they must be referred to
# by FQDN.

# @see man 5 resolv.conf
